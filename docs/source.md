# Source Code

Mathlingua is open source, and its source code can be found on its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mathlore/mathlingua).  It and related code can be found in the [Mathlingua GitHub organization](https://github.com/mathlingua).  Any questions, comments, feedback, or contributions are greatly appreciated.

A Mathlingua prototype was written in Kotlin but was re-written because of extensive changes needed to the AST to support more advanced type checking.

See the [Getting Started](./getting_started.md) for help getting started with the official Mathlingua implementation and visit [Mathlore](https://www.mathlore.org) to see the community mathematics collection written in Mathlingua.

Alternatively, visit the [Prototype](./prototype/index.html) page to see the prototype.

> Note: The syntax of the prototype is very different from current Mathlingua language.
