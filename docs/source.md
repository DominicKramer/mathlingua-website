A Mathlingua prototype was written in Kotlin but needed to be re-written because of extensive changes that needed to be made to the abstract syntax tree to support improvements to the type system.

For the re-write, the Go language was selected and, as of February 2023, the parser is mostly complete with work starting on the type checker.
