# About the Author

Mathlingua is designed and implemented by Dominic Kramer.

Dominic has a PhD in mathematics from Iowa State University, has over ten years of extensive software design and engineering experience in top companies such as Google, Databricks, and Boeing, and has spent much time, both professionally and personally, working in the area of computer and natural language design and implementation.

Dominic's interests focus on the intersection of mathematics and languages and includes all aspects of language design and usage ranging from traditional parser design and lambda calculus (ranging from simple to dependent type theory), all of the way to deep learning and large language models.

Dominic is particularly interested in how the design of a language's syntax and semantics shapes how concepts or applications can or cannot be easily expressed or implemented in that language.
