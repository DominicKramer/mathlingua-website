# Mathlore

Mathlore is the name of the website that will host the collection of mathematical knowledge encoded in the Mathlingua language with powerful features to allow one to easily search the knowledgebase.

## Status

Currently Mathlore is in the UI design phase and its progress is blocked on the Mathlingua compiler, specifically the (in progress) work in the type checker needed to render Mathlingua documents in the browser.
