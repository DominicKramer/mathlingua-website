For example, the group <code>exists:where:suchThat:</code> has three groups, <code>exists:</code>, <code>where:</code> and <code>suchThat:</code>.  Notice that a <code>:</code> follows a group name which is followed by one or more arguments.</p> <p>Multiple arguments can be specified on the same line, as long as they are not groups themselves, and are separated by commas.</p> <p>For example, in <code>exists: q, r</code> the group has arguments <code>q</code> and <code>r</code>.  These arguments could also be specified on their own lines (preceded with <code>.</code>) either as:</p> <pre><code>exists: q\n. r\n</code></pre> <p>or</p> <pre><code>exists:\n. q\n. r\n</code></pre> <p>However, if an argument to a section is a group, it must be specified on its own line.
